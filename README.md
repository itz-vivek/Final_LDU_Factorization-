# Final_LDU_Factorization-
LDU-Factorisation Using HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT
This project provides a tool to calculate the LDU Factorization of a given matrix. LDU Factorization is a method used in linear algebra to decompose a matrix -A

A into three matrices:

L (Lower triangular matrix)
D (Diagonal matrix)
U (Upper triangular matrix)
This factorization is useful for various applications in computational mathematics, including solving linear systems, simplifying matrix operations, and optimizing numerical calculations.

Features
Decomposition Calculation: Computes the LDU factorization of a user-provided square matrix.

Validation: Checks if the input matrix is decomposable using LDU factorization criteria.

Matrix Operations: Provides functions to reconstruct the original matrix from its L, D, and U components for validation.
